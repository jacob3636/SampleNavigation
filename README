--- Creating a new react native app:

Note: use npx as it eliminates the need to install any packages. npx will install them locally in the new app
      In the following example app name is: WebViewEX

npx react-native init WebViewEX

-- Install third party module: webView
cd WebViewEX
npm install --save react-native-webview

WebView - for more into see getting started docs:
https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started.md


--- Running your React Native application on Windows 10 with android emulator:

npx react-native run-android

Note: the above will start Metro (npx react-native start) as well as the Android emulator. No need to start Metro
	first manually. The above will span two windows and you need to keep the program running in the window
	where you executed the above command.
