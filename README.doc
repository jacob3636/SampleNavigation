			To add React Navigation to a React Native project which uses Expo, follow these instructions:

			# note: native-stack depends on the above two libs react-native-screens & react-native-safe-area-context
			# 		They are both native libs to react

			npm install @react-navigation/native-stack

			# For Tab navigation install:

			npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

			# For drawer Navigation install:

			npm install @react-navigation/drawer

			npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated

			*** babel.config.js - update file in project dir. After presets:... Add the line:
				plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],

			Note: for drawer navigation - if you get errors during npx run-android try to reset the cache
				npm start -- --reset-cache
				Note: when the prompts come up type a (a - run on Android)

***** React Native Vector Icons/Material

npm install react-native-vector-icons

Note: 1) See App.js file for example
      2) Vector icons has many font packages to choose from.
	  		e.g.: FontAwesome - a package with close to 800 quality fonts
			To view the fonts and get their names see:
			https://oblador.github.io/react-native-vector-icons/

      3) After installation you will need to do:

	For Android:
	Option: With Gradle (recommended)
This method has the advantage of fonts being copied from this module at build time so that the fonts and JS are always in sync, making upgrades painless.

==> Edit android/app/build.gradle ( NOT android/build.gradle ) and add the following:

apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
